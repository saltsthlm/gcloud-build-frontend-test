Just a test/demonstration of deploying a simple frontend to Google Cloud Run, built with Google Cloud Build with an environment variable passed from Cloud Build to the Docker image during build time.

This repo used to be called gh-actions-frontend-test, which was a misnomer; that's a different demo/test.
